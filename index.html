<h1 id="intro">Humanity could really use an upgrade.</h1>

<p>At least, according to transhumanists it could. </p>

<p><strong>Tranhumanism</strong> is a loosely defined movement to extend human physical and mental capabilities through technology. Sometimes abbreviated as <em>humanity+</em> or <em>H+</em>, Transhumanism is represented by a growing faction of scientists, policymakers, and thinkers who believe in the use of technology to enhance human life at an individual level.</p>

<p>It's regarded by some as quackary, others as a religion. It's related to concepts as abstract as the Singularity and technologies as widespread and contemporary as your smartphone. It means different things to different people, but I personally like to think of it as "hacking the human condition". </p>

<p>This site is a whirlwind look at some of the people, technologies, and ideas that are part of the modern Transhumanism movement. It's <a href="https://github.com/qrohlf/hplus">open-source</a> and under active development, so please let me know if you have any <a href="https://github.com/qrohlf/hplus/issues">feedback</a>.

<p>Let's get started...</p>

        <p>“Transhumanism is a class of philosophies of life that seek the continuation and acceleration of the evolution of intelligent life beyond its currently human form and human limitations by means of science and technology, guided by life-promoting principles and values.”</p>

<h1 id="origins">Origins of Transhumanism</h1>

<p>The term itself was coined by the biologist Julian Huxley as the title of his 1957 paper <em>Transhumanism</em> - a treatise on the potential of science, technology, and rationality to allow humanity to trancend it's current limitations and problems.</p>

<p>While the technologies and prominent figures in Transhumanism have changed since Huxley's time, the core purpose of the movement has remained the same: <em>to make humans better</em>.</p>
